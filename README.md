# online-apparel-shop

## Description

Developed a front-end demo application for an online apparel shop using React. The application showcases a comprehensive understanding of React's capabilities, including state management, side effects, navigation, and context API. Additionally, it incorporates React Router for seamless navigation and local storage for persistent cart functionality

- **Interactive User Interface**: Utilized React-Bootstrap for responsive and visually appealing UI components, and FontAwesome for scalable vector icons.
- **User Interactive Cart**: Designed an interactive shopping cart where users can add or remove items, and view the total price dynamically updated.
- **Context API**: Leveraged React's Context API to manage global state, providing a centralized store for the cart and user data.
- **Persistent Cart**: Used local storage to save cart items, ensuring the cart retains its state even after the browser is refreshed or closed.
- **Notifications**: Integrated Toastify for user notifications, providing feedback for actions such as adding or removing items from the cart.
